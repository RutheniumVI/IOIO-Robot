# IOIO-Robot
I used IOIO micro-controller to make a robot that can be controlled by and Android app, and also works autonomously. While autonomous, the system uses the 2 infrared sensors to detect the object in front of the robot, then the robot picks it up and places it on top of the blue car. The car is wifi-controlled using a Java program, and Arduino with WiFi shield. The car also has an infrared sensor, that allows the car to autnomously move to a pre set location once object has been placed on top.
